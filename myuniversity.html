   <h1>About my School</h1>
   <p>Given that we all attend the same school, I'm sure you all know mostly everything about it. Our school's name is Borough of Manhattan Community College.</p>
   <p>Our school's motto is "Start here. Go anywhere." The school is located at 199 Chambers St. (Main Campus).</p>
   <p>I am currently taking 5 courses, those being CSC 350, CSC 331, CIS 395, CSC 215, and PHY 215. It's a lot, but manageable.</p>
