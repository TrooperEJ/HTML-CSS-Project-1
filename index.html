   <h1>Welcome to My Page!</h1>
   <p>This is a simple website I designed to share interesting facts about me.</p>
   <p>My name is Ezequiel, pronounced the same as Ezekiel, but most of my friends call me Zeke.</p>
   <p>I am a Computer Science major currently in my last semester at BMCC.</p>
   <p>My favorite hobby is skateboarding, as I've been skating since I was 3. So about 20 years now.</p>
   <p>My other hobbies include reading, writing, cooking, gaming, fitness, and fashion.</p>
